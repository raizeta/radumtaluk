How to Contribute to MessiJS
============================

I welcome all contributions to MessiJS.  Please send me a pull
request.  I do reserve the right of determining what features will
go into MessiJS.

**NOTE:** I believe that well-formatted, well-tested, well-structured
code is a joy to use and a joy to develop.  Please include Mocha
tests with bug reports (where possible) and especially with new
features.

Setting up a development environment
------------------------------------

1. git clone ...
2. npm install
3. gulp  _then verify all tests are passing_
4. Add a test for your Issue or new feature
5. `<coding happens>`
6. Verify your new code passes JSHint validation and your new test(s) are passing.
7. Send me a Pull Request.

Yes, it's that easy. :wink:
